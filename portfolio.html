                <h2>MCU Power BI Dashboard Project</h2>
                <p><span class="bold">Summary:</span> With my interest in Marvel Cinamatic Universe movies and data analysis, I created a fun MCU dashboard in Power BI
                    to
                    answer some questions I had regarding the franchise. </p>

                <p><span class="bold">Process:</span> I pulled a public MCU data set from Kaggle and converted it to an Excel file then uploaded
                    it to
                    Power BI. When digging into the Kaggle data set, I found that it was three years out of date and
                    missing
                    5 of the newest MCU movies. So I searched other websites and manually found and input the data I was
                    looking for into a new Excel file. Then, in Power BI, I merged the tables together. After some data
                    cleaning, I created 4 new calculated columns and 2 new measures to answer my research questions. Then
                    I
                    created visuals to display some of the most interesting data insights I could find. </p>

                <h2>Excel Home Depot Project</h2>
                <p><span class="bold">Summary:</span> What started as a simple Excel school project slowly turned into a personal passion project
                    as I expanded well beyond the assignment. I was working with a mock Home Depot data set and the
                    assignment was to create a simple graph with a pivot table. But as I worked, I became curious of the
                    data and decided to make it a personal project. I created an interactive dashboard with slicers and
                    forecast orders for the next quarter as well as delivery times by region and more!</p>
                <img src="graphics/Excel project dash.png" alt=MCU Power BI Project Dashboard>
                <p><span class="bold">Process:</span> I first created my pivot tables from the data and mapped out what questions I wanted to
                    answer. Then I used my pivot tables to create the graphs and slicers I would need. For my order
                    forecasting, I decided to use a custom four-month weighted moving average. I saw that the trend line
                    was mostly flat, and the variability was mostly seasonal, so I weighted the same month last year to
                    50% and the previous 3 months 30%, 10% and 10% respectively. Then I formatted the dashboard, and I
                    had some interesting insights. </p>
